Here is an update of the script, it now has:
- Even "water" distribution, with noise
- Makes layers for both the trails and the heightcurves
- Makes polylines instead of single line pieces
- Adds points to the ends of the trails
- Stops some of the curves.

Unsolved:
- Density, now you have to scale the terrain.
- Stop trails at the surface edge.
- Avoid invalid trailing
( Intersection can result in faulty heightcurves that can result in faulty jumps to heightcurves)
- Stop trailing at the bottom of a "pool"
- and more :)
- mesh handling
