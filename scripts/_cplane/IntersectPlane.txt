Here is a quickly modified version of IntersectPlane that includes the alias

TrimWithPlane

To use the script, extract and save the .rvb file, then drag and drop it over an open V4 window to add the following aliases:

IntersectPlane
TrimWithPlane

These can be used as 'commands' by typing or by adding  to a button.

Let me know how that works...
